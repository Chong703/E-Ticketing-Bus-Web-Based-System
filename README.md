# Web Based System of E-Ticketing Bus System

- IBM4202_JAN2020_Project

Create a Web Based System of E-Ticketing Bus which allow the customers and the admin 
to access and sign out from the system . In addition, the system should provide registration 
module for the customer. Take note that the system should implement the session as security towards the 
web page where necessary. The system must consist of at least FIVE (5) friendly linked web pages which 
display relevant information etc., and allow user to perform transactions via the web page.  As for example, 
the system will allow the customer to book tickets and view the booked tickets etc., while the admin is able 
to view the booked tickets and apply some modification (delete, update etc.) where necessary. Take note 
that the project will be developed based on Hypertext Pre-processor (PHP) and Hypertext Markup 
Language (HTML) scripting language. However it is also possible to integrate with other languages where 
possible.
